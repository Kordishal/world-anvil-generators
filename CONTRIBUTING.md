### Contributing

Adding a generator or template to World Anvil Generators consists largly of two steps:

#### Data Colletion
In order to fill a generator with data it is necessary to collect and curate this data first. 
Provide links to lists on a website with public resources or create and share a Google Sheet. This will form the basis for
any generator or template.

#### Logic & Weights

Create a weighted graph that shows how the collected data influences each other while generating.


#### Template Text
In order to create prose descriptions, variant text templates are needed. These text templates then have specific words which can be randomized. 
The more variation the text templates have the more varied the results will be.
